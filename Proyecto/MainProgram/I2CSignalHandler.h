 *
 * Provides an interface to handle incoming I2C signals and map them to
 * high-level control commands. Used for inter-device communication,
 * typically between a master controller and a slave module that performs
 * security or mechanical actions.
 *
 * Signal Definitions:
 * - 'F' : Triggers a password reset
 * - 'C' : Closes a motor lock mechanism
 * - 'S' : Skips the authentication process
